# C runtime DLLs

`ucrtbased.dll` was copied from `/src/IpaSimulator/Debug/IpaSimApp/AppX/`
(after building `IpaSimApp` in Visual Studio). `ucrtbased.pdb` was copied from
Visual Studio's symbol cache (after enabling Microsoft Symbol Servers).
`ucrtbased.dll.a` was copied from
`C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Lib/10.0.17134.0/ucrt/x86/`. Originally,
it was called `ucrtd.lib`.
