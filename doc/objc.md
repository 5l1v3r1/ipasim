# Objective-C runtime

Because the GNUstep runtime used by WinObjC is binary incompatible with the Apple's runtime used on iPhones, we cannot simply use it.
If we did, the runtime couldn't read the structures in the iPhone app binary as they are in Apple's format and the runtime expects them in its own different format.

So, the only option we see here is to recompile WinObjC with a different runtime (and pass clang a parameter to generate the Apple's structures - it can definitely do that since it's the compiler used on Apple for development).

## Existing runtimes

- Apple's runtime
  - Source code: [Official](https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/), [Tarballs](https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/objc4/), [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/opensource-apple/objc4) (not updated so often)
  - Documentation: [Official](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective_c_runtime?language=objc)
- Modular Objective-C Run-Time Library
  - Source code: [GitHub](https://github.com/charlieMonroe/modular-objc-run-time)
  - Master Thesis: [Local copy](../res/modular-objc.pdf), [CUNI repository](https://is.cuni.cz/webapps/zzp/detail/116510/29583005/)

**TODO: Add more.**

## Porting the Apple's runtime

One cool thing to do would be to just take the source code for Apple's Objective-C runtime and compile it for Windows.
Links to projects that try to do that follow.
