Forked from <https://github.com/ributzka/tapi>.

## Building

We don't build this directly, we just include some source files in project `HeadersAnalyzer`.
That is also what others do, see for example [Swift's `TBDGen`](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/2f4e70bf7f4eee43bfb2f24d6215eb1f63c05d01/lib/TBDGen/).
