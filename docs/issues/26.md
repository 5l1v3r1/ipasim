# `#26`: [cg] Calling Clang and LLD

## Problem

We link LLD unnecessarily and maybe some of Clang, too. We could just execute
the corresponding patched binary instead. It's what Clang does now anyway (its
fronted will call entirely new Clang process).

## Workaround

We specified exact path to our patched executable in `ClangHelper`. That way,
Clang driver executes the correct `clang.exe` as its subprocess.
