# `#3`: [build] I/O errors writing files to mounted directories in Docker

Due to this issue, our `lld-link` couldn't create an output file.
We temporarily resolved this by building inside the Docker machine (outside the mounted volume).
Use scripts `backup.ps1` and `restore.ps1` to copy the build outputs between the Docker machine and the host.
