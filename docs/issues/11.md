# `#11`: [woc] Circular dependency between UIKit and AutoLayout

## Problem

See also [`[uikit-autolayout]`](../winobjc.md).

## Old solution

We unreferenced AutoLayout from UIKit (it wasn't useful reference anyway - see
`UIView.mm`). We had to reference UIKit from AutoLayout, though.

## Current solution

We load AutoLayout dynamically at runtime.
