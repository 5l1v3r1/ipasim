# `#15`: [build] Ninja error opening build log

## Problem

Sometimes, we try tu run multiple Ninja commands in the same working directory
in parallel. Those processes both try to access the same build log `.ninja_log`
and maybe also some other shared files. So one of those processes fails with the
error `ninja: error: opening build log: Permission denied` or something similar.

## Proposed solution

We should group all Ninja commands in the same directory into one Ninja pool. If
CMake cannot do this, we could use the `console` pool. That can be done from
CMake using `USES_TERMINAL`.
