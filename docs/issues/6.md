# `#6`: [woc] Unexpected `@` in program

## Problem

```
C:/ipaSim/src/deps/WinObjC/include\Foundation/NSRunLoop.h:36:1: error: unexpected '@' in program
@interface NSRunLoop : NSObject
^
```

## Cause

This is caused by `#define interface struct` deep inside `<Windows.h>`. More
specifically, the include chain is following:

- Windows.h
- ole2.h
- coml2api.h
- combaseapi.h

## Workaround

We wrap `#include <Windows.h>` like this:

```cpp
#include <COMIncludes.h>
#include <Windows.h>
#include <COMIncludes_End.h>
```

In `COMIncludes_End.h`, there is `#undef interface`.

## Future work

**TODO: Why didn't this happen while building WinObjC using MSBuild?**
