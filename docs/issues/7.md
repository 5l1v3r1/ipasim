# `#7`: [build] Failing to pull submodule PlistCpp

## Problem

In Azure DevOps build:

```
error: Server does not allow request for unadvertised object 51f3a6e246ec8ae9adae8984a7b7e22c122d678c
Fetched in submodule path 'deps/WinObjC/tools/vsimporter/third-party/PlistCpp', but it did not contain 51f3a6e246ec8ae9adae8984a7b7e22c122d678c. Direct fetching of that commit failed.
Failed to recurse into submodule path 'deps/WinObjC'
```

See [build #20181226.5](https://jjones.visualstudio.com/ipasim-build/_build/results?buildId=626).
