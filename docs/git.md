# Git

## Commit messages

Since our project's code base has grown rather large, we add tags in front of commit messages to categorize them.
See below for list of tags used and their respective meanings.
Also, we write commit messages as whole sentences (i.e., starting with capital letter and ending with a period).
And usually when there is more than one sentence, only the first is on the first line (along with the tag), acting as kind of a headline (some Git tools even highlight the first line).

### Tags

- [objc] - Objective-C runtime library (`/src/objc/`).
- [docs] - Documentation (`/docs/`).
- [deps] - 3rd-party dependencies (`/deps/`).
